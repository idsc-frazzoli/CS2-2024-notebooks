    "Welcome to the CSII Jupyter Notebooks! This first notebook is designed to help you become familiar with the `control` library in Python, a powerful tool for analyzing and designing control systems. The exercises are structured to cover various aspects of the library, from basic transfer function creation to the analysis of time and frequency responses. By the end of this session, you'll have worked with control systems and even designed a low pass filter.\n",
